<h2> Typebot </h2>
<lr>
This code was written by Siddhant Sharma. It focuses on Using Pytessaract to create type bot, 
the concept is that you press "[" on top left and "]" on buttom right.
When pressed Enter the bot will type all the text on the selected area within the top left and 
buttom right.

The idea is to take the screenshot of the area of interest which will be converted to text from image and can be typed at high speed pace.
